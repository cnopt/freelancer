# Overview

In this project, I chose to add live data visualisations that reflected the state of the site as a whole, to be viewed from the perspective of users -- i.e. freelancers -- looking to find work on the site. These interactive and sometimes animated visualisations were modelled directly on site data. This meant that users could see a sort of "heartbeat" of the site, and decide for themselves if it was a platform they wanted to invest their time into.


---
I was responsible for deciding which metrics to store and document, the visual language, the graphs/charts I would use, how I would present the data, and how to achieve a level of interactivity with each chart. Some charts adjust when clicking different buttons, whereas some charts offer simple interactivty by hovering over data points to see specific values.


The visualisations, written using the D3 javascript framework, are diplayed on a subsection of the site. Within that, there are 6 pages that each encompass general themes for the data interpreted and displayed. There are pages for:

* Job postings
* Popular technologies
* Salaries for popular technologies
* Users by country
* Users by experience level

Each of these pages have several unique, interactive graphs.
